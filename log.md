# 100 Days Of Code - Log
The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 11, Monday, 2020].

### Day 1: May 11, 2020, Monday
##### Etch A Sketch

**Today's Progress**: Practiced my JS and CSS skills, I learned more about EventListeners and a bit on Canvas.

**Thoughts:** Made an Etch-a-sketch from an exercise of the @WesBos beginner js course.
I practiced my CSS skills trying to replicate an illustration from @blakestevenson
and I'm actually happy with the results.

### Day 2: May 12, 2020, Tuesday
##### Etch A Sketch

**Today's Progress**: Practice more JS and a bit of CSS, I learned more about EventListeners and practiced how to create more functions and manipulate the DOM.

**Thoughts:** Made a dead simple calculator based on a tutorial but trying to come with my own solution,
I feel like my code could be better and I don't think I fully understand everything that I did,
but at least I got something working.
