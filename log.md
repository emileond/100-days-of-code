# 100 Days Of Code - Log
The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 11, Monday, 2020].

### Day 1: May 11, 2020, Monday
##### Etch A Sketch

**Today's Progress**: Practiced my JS and CSS skills, I learned more about EventListeners and a bit on Canvas.

**Thoughts:** Made an Etch-a-sketch from an exercise of the @WesBos beginner js course.
I practiced my CSS skills trying to replicate an illustration from @blakestevenson
and I'm actually happy with the results.

### Day 2: May 12, 2020, Tuesday
##### Etch A Sketch

**Today's Progress**: Practiced more JS and a bit of CSS, I learned more about EventListeners and practiced how to create more functions and manipulate the DOM.

**Thoughts:** Made a dead simple calculator based on a tutorial but trying to come with my own solution,
I feel like my code could be better and I don't think I fully understand everything that I did,
but at least I got something working.

### Day 3: May 14, 2020, Thursday
##### FreeCodeCamp - Basic Javascript

**Today's Progress**: Practiced JS. Specifically loops and a bit on recursive functions.

**Thoughts:** Hard day. I didn't have much time so I spend one hour practicing the 
@freeCodeCamp JS Path, got stuck in a for-loop challenge and I feel a bit frustrated. Code is hard.

Hopefully tomorrow will be a better day and I'd make more progress.


### Day 4: May 16, 2020, Thursday
##### FreeCodeCamp - Basic Javascript

**Today's Progress**: Practiced JS: Ternary Opeerators, destructuring, spread and rest operators.

**Thoughts:** Small wins. Today I'm more satisfied with my progress since I finally completed the 
@freeCodeCamp Beginner JS path and started their ES6 Lessons.

I'm still struggling a bit with destructuring but I'm feeeling more comfortable each day.

### Day 5: Jun 16, 2020, Thursday
##### WesBos - Click Outside

**Today's Progress**: Practiced JS: Learned how to make a modal with a click-outside functionallity.

**Thoughts:** I'm retaking this, today I studied some thinngs from the Wes Bos' beginner course. I learned how to make a modal with a click-outside functionallity that shows and hides that modal, Tomorrow I'll try to do that from scratch without folowwing the video.
