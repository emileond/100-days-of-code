The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 11, Monday, 2020].

### Day 1: May 11, 2020, Monday
##### Etch A Sketch

**Today's Progress**: Practiced my JS and CSS skills, I learned more about EventListeners and a bit on Canvas.

**Thoughts:** Made an Etch-a-sketch from an exercise of the @WesBos beginner js course.
I practiced my CSS skills trying to replicate an illustration from @blakestevenson
and I'm actually happy with the results.

### Day 2: May 12, 2020, Tuesday
##### Etch A Sketch

**Today's Progress**: Practiced more JS and a bit of CSS, I learned more about EventListeners and practiced how to create more functions and manipulate the DOM.

**Thoughts:** Made a dead simple calculator based on a tutorial but trying to come with my own solution,
I feel like my code could be better and I don't think I fully understand everything that I did,
but at least I got something working.

### Day 3: May 14, 2020, Thursday
##### FreeCodeCamp - Basic Javascript

**Today's Progress**: Practiced JS. Specifically loops and a bit on recursive functions.

**Thoughts:** Hard day. I didn't have much time so I spend one hour practicing the 
@freeCodeCamp JS Path, got stuck in a for-loop challenge and I feel a bit frustrated. Code is hard.

Hopefully tomorrow will be a better day and I'd make more progress.


### Day 4: May 16, 2020, Thursday
##### FreeCodeCamp - Basic Javascript

**Today's Progress**: Practiced JS: Ternary Opeerators, destructuring, spread and rest operators.

**Thoughts:** Small wins. Today I'm more satisfied with my progress since I finally completed the 
@freeCodeCamp Beginner JS path and started their ES6 Lessons.

I'm still struggling a bit with destructuring but I'm feeeling more comfortable each day.

### Day 5: Jun 16, 2020, Tuesday
##### WesBos - Click Outside

**Today's Progress**: Practiced JS: Learned how to make a modal with a click-outside functionallity.

**Thoughts:** I'm retaking this, today I studied some thinngs from the Wes Bos' beginner course. I learned how to make a modal with a click-outside functionallity that shows and hides that modal, Tomorrow I'll try to do that from scratch without folowwing the video.

### Day 6: Jun 17, 2020, Wednesday
##### WesBos - Click Outside Modal & Scroll to Accept
**Thoughts:** Today I completed the Modal Click Outside Excersize without watching the video again, just following my notes. I really liked this method, I thinnk I'll keep using it. Also I watched the next lesson; "Scroll to Accept" and took some notes to redoit it tomorrow by myself.

### Day 7: Jun 18, 2020, Thursday
##### WesBos - Scroll to Accept
**Thoughts:** Completed the Scroll to Accept exercize, I'm really happy about it because I make it work without much trouble. I had to watch the video but only for adding some nice to have functionallity, I'm really glad I'm trying this studying technique about wattching stuff and taking notes and then tryinng to do it by myself.

### Day 8: Jun 21, 2020, Sunday
##### WesBos - Tabs & BEDMAS
**Thoughts:** Studied the Tabs excersise from the Beginnner JS course, took a lot of notes to replicate it tomorrow without watching the class again. I also watched a small lesson about BEDMAS.

### Day 9: Jun 22, 2020, Monday
##### WesBos - Tabs & BEDMAS
**Thoughts:** Replicated the tabs lesson from yesterday with not much problem. Also studied a bit on flow control, if statements and function returns (truthly, falsy).

### Day 10: Jun 26, 2020, Thursday
##### WesBos - Coercion, Ternaries, Case Switch and Animating a Turtle with CSS Variables
**Thoughts:** Studied coercion, ternary operators, case switch and watched an excercise for moving a turtle with css variables. I'll try to replicate the excercise tomorrow only with my notes.


### Day 10: Jun 28, 2020, Saturday
##### WesBos - Coercion, Ternaries, Case Switch and Animating a Turtle with CSS Variables
**Thoughts:** Replicated the turtle excercise, I had some bumps but I was able to do it like 70% without seeking for guidance. After that I studied a bit on intervals and Timers, all of this in the Wes Bos Beginner JS course.
