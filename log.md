# 100 Days Of Code - Log
The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 11, Monday, 2020].

### Day 1: May 11, 2020, Monday
##### Etch A Sketch

**Today's Progress**: Practiced my JS and CSS skills, I learned more about EventListeners and a bit on Canvas.

**Thoughts:** Made an Etch-a-sketch from an exercise of the @WesBos beginner js course.
I practiced my CSS skills trying to replicate an illustration from @blakestevenson
and I'm actually happy with the results.
