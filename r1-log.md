## Log

### R1D1 
Made an Etch-a-sketch from an exercise of the @WesBos beginner js course.
I practiced my CSS skills trying to replicate an illustration from @blakestevenson
and I'm actually happy with the results.

### R1D2
Made a dead simple calculator based on a tutorial but trying to come with my own solution,
I feel like my code could be better and I don't think I fully understand everything that I did, but at least I got something working.
