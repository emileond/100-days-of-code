## Log

### R1D1 
Made an Etch-a-sketch from an exercise of the @WesBos beginner js course.
I practiced my CSS skills trying to replicate an illustration from @blakestevenson
and I'm actually happy with the results.

### R1D2
Made a dead simple calculator based on a tutorial but trying to come with my own solution,
I feel like my code could be better and I don't think I fully understand everything that I did, but at least I got something working.

### R1D3
Hard day. I didn't have much time so I spend one hour practicing the @freeCodeCamp JS Path (mostly loops and a bit on recursive functions), got stuck in a for-loop challenge and I feel a bit frustrated. Code is hard.

Hopefully tomorrow will be a better day and I'd make more progress.

### R1D4
Small wins. Today I'm more satisfied with my progress since I finally completed the @freeCodeCamp Beginner JS path and started their ES6 Lessons. I'm still struggling a bit with destructuring but I'm feeeling more comfortable each day.

Practiced JS Ternary Opeerators, destructuring, spread and rest operators.

### R1D5
I'm retaking this, today I studied some thinngs from the Wes Bos' beginner course. I learned how to make a modal with a click-outside functionallity that shows and hides that modal, Tomorrow I'll try to do that from scratch without folowwing the video.

### R1D6
Today I completed the Modal Click Outside Excersize without watching the video again, just following my notes. I really liked this method, I thinnk I'll keep using it. Also I watched the next lesson; "Scroll to Accept" and took some notes to redoit it tomorrow by myself.

### R1D7
Completed the Scroll to Accept exercize, I'm really happy about it because I make it work without much trouble. I had to watch the video but only for adding some nice to have functionallity, I'm really glad I'm trying this studying technique about wattching stuff and taking notes and then tryinng to do it by myself.
